        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?</p>
        <p>In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we reveal that---even when they lead to the same level of overall balance---different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology. Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI communication.</p>

      People on the left are having a great time sharing personal stories 
      and genuinely listening to one another, while the ones on the right 
      struggle to find common ground and end up stuck in surface-level chit-chat. 
      Yet even though in both situations the speakers are sharing talk-time equally, 
      the types of talk-time-sharing dynamics they exhibit are perceived very differently.
